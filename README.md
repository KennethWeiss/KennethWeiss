## About Me
I am passionate software development with expertise in various programming languages and technologies. I love solving complex problems and creating efficient, scalable solutions. 
I have been passionate about software development for sometime.  I love solving complex problems and finding ways that code can make my life easier.  I love playing with different technologies, but life took me in a different direction.  Every path I went down somehow I found a way to integrate coding.  I worked in FCC licensing and created a fullstack application using PHP and MySQL to give us better access to all of our records and invoices.  When I was a server I used androidsdk to create an android app to help servers calculate their tipshare.  The project that I am most proud of is one that I made while I was a teacher.  I created a python program that would create math problems.  These math problems were exported to an excel spreadsheet in a format the could be imported into activInspire, which is a program our district used.  Creating this program showed me that as much as I enjoyed teaching it was these programs that were my true passion.  I am currently enrolled in a program at Coding Dojo to further my skills in Full stack programming using Python, Flask, and Django as well as front end technologies including HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap.
